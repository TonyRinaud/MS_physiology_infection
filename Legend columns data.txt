Nest: Identifier for unique nest where the nestlings hatched
Date: Date of second sampling
Year: Year of second sampling
Ring_no: Ring number attributed to the nestlings at first sampling
Infection_intensity.2: Parasitic load from microscopy estimation at second sampling
Weight.2: Weight at second sampling in gram
Wing.2: Wing length at second sampling in cm
Sex: sex of the nestling determined either molecularly or morphometrics
Breathing_rate: time in second for 30 breathings
body_temperature: cloacal temperature measured with an digital thermometer
TemperatureAvgC: Average temperature the day of sampling
Sampling_rank: order of the nestling in the brood
Treatment: Treatment group, either control or malarone-treated nestlings
Growth_rate: daily mass gain, as the difference in weigth between the two sampling, control by the delay between sampling events
days_resample: interval in days between sampling events 
body_condition.2: residual variance of the regression between weight and wing length, controlled for sex, all as recorded at second sampling
delta_body_condition: difference between body condition.2 and body condition.1
Age_in_days: estimate age of the nestlings
intensity_change: difference between infection intensity.2 and infection intensity.1, uninfected nestlings coded as -100
Diff_Inf_Class: Verbal grouping of the intensity change.
Weight.1: weigth in gram at first sampling
body_condition.1: residual variance of the regression between weight and wing length, controlled for sex, all as recorded at first sampling
Infection_intensity.1: Parasitic load from microscopy estimation at first sampling
